# task-manager

This project is a REST API created using Node.js and Express. It stores information about tasks in a MongoDB database. The user will be able to create, read, update and delete tasks. The user will be able to add a description for a task and indicate whether the task is completed or not.

This API uses JWT for authentication and the bcrypt library for hashing passwords.

What I have learnt during this project:
  - MongoDB and Mongoose
  - How to Structure a REST API
  - Express - Including Middleware
  - Promises and Asynchronous JavaScript
  - Authentication using JWT
