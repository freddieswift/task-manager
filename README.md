# task-manager

This project is a REST API created using Node.js and Express. It stores information about tasks in a MongoDB database. The user will be able to create, read, update and delete tasks. The user will be able to add a description for a task and indicate whether the task is completed or not.

I plan to add user authentication to this API as well as explore file upload to add a profile picture for each user.
